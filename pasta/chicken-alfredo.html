    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
        Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to the packeage 
    directions, usually 10 minutes. reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the chicken:</strong> Season chicken breasts with the italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat 
    in a larg nonstick skillet. Once it's shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly 
    distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom 
    is golden-brown. Flip ovewr and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, 
    picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes 
    (or an internal temperature reaches 165 defrees F.)</li>
    <li></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoid pre-shedded cheese.</strong> For best results and taste,
        use real Parmigiano-Reggiano right off the block.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't over cook the chicken. </strong>Use an instant-read thermometer
         so you can know exactly when the chicken is done and you don't have to guess.</li>
         <li><strong>The pasta.</strong> A long, flat noodle like Fettucine is perfect here.
         Linguini and penne are also good options for pasta.</li>
         <li><strong>have everything ready before you start,</strong> Time can go by fast
         and you might find yourself rushing to find ingredients if you don't have them ready
         when you start.</li>
         <li><strong>Sauce too thing?</strong> You can either simmer for a few extra minutes 
        or take it off the heat and let it sit for a minute or two before you mix it with 
        the pasta. Alternetively, if you think it is too thick, add some reserved pasta water 
        to loosen it up a bit.</li>
        <li><strong>Want to lighten it up></strong>This is a high calorie meal and if you want to 
        die it down a little, use half-n-half or whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream. 
        Just remember, the lower the fat content, the thinner the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut the chicken:</strong> Transfer the chicken to a cutting board 
        and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent 
        with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce:</strong> In the same pan, over 
        medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
    </ul>
